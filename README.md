## Dataset Description
The dataset is provided as a CSV file: **`north_america_cars_1984_2025.csv`**.
### **Columns**
- **`cylinders`**: Number of cylinders in the engine.
- **`make`**: Manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Toyota, Ford, etc.).
- **`model`**: Specific variant of the vehicle (e.g., Corolla HEV, F-150 XLT).
- **`VClass`**: Vehicle class, such as "car," "truck," "SUV," "sedan," or "van."  
  - **Note**: We did our best to assign accurate vehicle classes. While most vehicles are classified, around 700 rows remain labeled as "Special Purpose Vehicle" and need further refinement.
- **`year`**: Year the vehicle was manufactured.
- **`baseModel`**: Base designation of the model (e.g., Corolla, F-150).
- **`atvType`**: Indicates the type of ATV (if applicable).

## Features and Notes
1. **Vehicle Class**:  
   The dataset includes the primary vehicle classes: *car, truck, SUV, sedan, and van*. While we manually classified most vehicles, approximately 700 rows remain unclassified ("Special Purpose Vehicle") and would benefit from contributions to refine these entries.
2. **Duplicates Removed**:  
   We cleaned the dataset by removing duplicate entries.
3. **Base Model vs. Model**:  
   The `baseModel` column represents the general model name (e.g., Corolla), while the `model` column provides the specific variant (e.g., Corolla HEV, Corolla XSE).
4. **Added Original `vehicles.csv`**:  
   We have added the original **`vehicles.csv`** file from [FuelEconomy.gov](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml) to this repository. This file is provided as a copy for users who prefer to perform their own data cleaning or analysis. Feel free to modify and adapt the data to suit your needs. Both the cleaned **`north_america_cars_1984_2025.csv`** and the unaltered **`vehicles.csv`** are now available in the repository, giving you flexibility in how you work with the data.
